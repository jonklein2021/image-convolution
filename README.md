# image-manipulation
C++ image processing using convolution matrices

## Build & Run Instructions
```
make
./build/bin/main
```

## TODOs
- Enable support for kernels with negative entries
- Parallelize convolution code via multi-threading
- Enable support for JPEG (and maybe PNG) images
- Apply FFT to convolution code
